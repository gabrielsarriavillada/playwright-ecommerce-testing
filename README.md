# Playwright E-commerce Testing

UI automation and exploratory testing solution developed as part of the technical assignment for the **Senior QA Engineer** position at Qualifyze.

The project demonstrates a maintainable Playwright + TypeScript automation framework using the Page Object Model, together with a risk-based exploratory testing approach and structured bug reporting.

## Scope

### Test Strategy

A concise test plan describing:

- Testing scope and priorities
- Test types
- Assumptions
- Automation strategy
- Out-of-scope items

Location:

```
docs/test-plan.md
```

### Exploratory Testing

The exploratory testing results are documented as individual bug reports, prioritized by business impact.

Location:

```
docs/bugs/
```

### UI Automation

The automated scenarios cover the business-critical purchase flow:

- Successful login with `standard_user`
- Successful purchase flow
- Login validation for `locked_out_user`

The automation is implemented using:

- Playwright
- TypeScript
- Page Object Model (POM)

## Design Decisions

- Stable `data-test` selectors are preferred whenever available.
- Page Object Model is used to improve readability and maintainability.
- Assertions are encapsulated within Page Objects to keep test scenarios focused on business workflows.
- Test data is separated from test logic to improve readability and reduce duplication.
- Exploratory testing findings are prioritized according to business impact rather than discovery order.
